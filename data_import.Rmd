## Read in some data

Read in the litters dataset (IMPORTING CSV FILE)
1. litters_df = imported CSV will become a data frame that is named "litters_df"
2. read_csv = pacakge w/in readr
3. "./data/FAS_litters.csv" = pathway
4. overwrite litters_df by cleaning the names using "clean_names(litters_df)"
5. janitors::clean_names --> we are using clean_names within janitor package
```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```
